# concourse-102
After failing to set up concourse with docker, I decided to go with the more
traditional way of deploying concourse using vagrant. Simple steps to do that

- Install [vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/)
- Install one of the virtual machine technologies vagrant supports, in my case
  [virtualbox](https://www.virtualbox.org/)
- Clone concourse/lite from [github](https://github.com/concourse/concourse-lite)
- `vagrant up`

## concourse-tutorial from Stark & Wayne
It is the most complete, most explained tutorial for concourse, period. So you
better clone that.

- `git clone https://github.com/starkandwayne/concourse-tutorial`
